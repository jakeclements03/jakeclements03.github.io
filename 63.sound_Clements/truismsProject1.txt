Truisms Project: Update #1: Video

1. I currently am a cast member in the Disney College Program at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The nametag I wear simply tells guests where I go to college and the name I go by: Jake. The truism I chose is "A name means a lot just by itself." The transition from the Midwest to the South has been difficult, as I miss the colder weather, the consistency of school, and my friends and family. When I get home from a long day at work, I take my nametag off and look at it. The bold letters scream my name, "JAKE," so guests have something to address me as if they choose, but I often find it a little sad that I have to wear a single name at all times. At home, I'm known as "brother," "son," "boyfriend," "friend," "Jakey," "Jacob," and countless other names that those close to me have given. While at work, guests also often ignore my name entirely, and instead of addressing me as they should, I am reduced to a "stranger," "worker," "cast member," "idiot," "fag," "cunt," and "demon," all names I have been called while on the job.

2. The video is of my lips naming the people in my life closest to me, with each bringing back distinct memories and images of each individual.
